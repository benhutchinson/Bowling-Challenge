My Notes


- you start out with

    board = new ScoreBoard();
    frame = new Frame();
    frame2 = new Frame();
    roll1 = new Roll();
    roll2 = new Roll();


- you roll
	roll.attempt();
	frame.storeRoll(roll1);

- you roll again (unless strike, second roll.hitPins = 0)
	roll.attempt();
	frame.storeRoll(roll2);

- a frame concludes
	board.storeFrame(frame);

- we need to check if this frame was a strike, spare, or normal
- we need to recognise this now and store the frame's status
	board.storeFrameStatusForNextRound(frame);

- we need to calculate the basic points scored in this frame for the pins hit in this frame
- these will need to be incremented if a bonus was awarded from the previous frame
	board.calculateRunningTotal(frame);

- we should now consider if we can output that result now
